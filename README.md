# car-classification
The challenge in car classification using Neural Networks is to create an efficient and effective algorithm that can accurately
 classify vehicles based on their physical features. Thus, the successful completion of this project is contingent on the programmer's 
ability to implement innovative techniques for pattern recognition. As such, I expect the programmer to demonstrate an in-depth
 understanding of the problem domain, as well as a commitment to developing codes that contain readable and well-structured logic.
